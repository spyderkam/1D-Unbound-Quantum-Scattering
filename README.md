# One-Dimensional Quantum Scattering; Unbound Particles
The problem is: **The table below shows the dependence of the reflection coefficients on scattering energy. Determine the one-dimensional scattering potential. Use $m=1=\hslash$.**

Using experimentally obtained energies and reflection coefficients, one can computationally find the potentials corresponding to each $R$ and $E$.
