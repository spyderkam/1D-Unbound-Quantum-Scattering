# One-Dimensional Quantum Scattering; Unbound Particles
%Scattering potential fitted computationally using experimentally obtained energy and reflection coefficients.

Using experimentally obtained energies and reflection coefficients, one can computationally find the potentials corresponding to each $R$ and $E$.
