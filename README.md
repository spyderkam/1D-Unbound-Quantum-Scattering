## Notes
- Please see the [wiki home page](https://github.com/spyderkam/1D-Unbound-Scattering/wiki) for $\LaTeX$ write up of the problem.
- IMPORTANT: This result is essentially the same as the [solution of Schr√∂dinger equation for a step potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_of_Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation_for_a_step_potential).
- The Julia script *does not* include the curve fitting at this time.
- The Python 3 script *does* include the full solution.
